        "question": "Are BSBI Programmes FIBAA accredited?",
        "answer": "No, BSBI programmes are not accredited by FIBAA. All programmes offered at the Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI) are awarded by its accredited university partners, each of which holds its own degree-awarding powers and official recognition from national education authorities. These partner universities — including Università Telematica Internazionale UNINETTUNO, Concordia University Chicago, the University of Roehampton London, the University for the Creative Arts, and the University of Chichester — are fully recognised institutions in their respective countries and listed as H+ institutions in Germany by Anabin. This means that while BSBI itself does not hold programme-level FIBAA accreditation, the degrees students receive are internationally recognised and awarded by universities that meet established national and international quality assurance standards."

        "question": "Our MA/MSc/MBA degrees award 90 ECTS. Will I still be able to gain admission to a doctorate or PhD?",
        "answer": "Admission to a doctoral or PhD programme depends on the specific entry requirements of the university and country where you wish to study. While BSBI’s postgraduate programmes — such as the MA, MSc and MBA — award 90 ECTS credits, eligibility for doctoral-level study (third-cycle qualifications) is determined individually by each institution. Under the Italian higher education framework, a UNINETTUNO master’s degree (classified as a “Master’s Degree of Primo Livello”) does not automatically guarantee direct entry into a doctoral or PhD programme. Typically, applicants are expected to demonstrate a strong academic background equivalent to five years of higher education (combining first and second cycle studies), along with a solid research proposal. Admission decisions are based on merit and the specific criteria of each university. However, many BSBI graduates who have completed master’s degrees awarded by UNINETTUNO have successfully progressed to doctoral studies at recognised universities without difficulty. Additionally, UNINETTUNO now offers its own Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) programme through BSBI in Berlin, providing a clear academic progression route for students who wish to continue their studies at a doctoral level. Please also note that admission to doctoral programs requires strong GPAs, research proposals, and relevant experience. For BSBI programmes delivered in partnership with other universities: The University for the Creative Arts (UCA) uses the UK credit system, where bachelor’s degrees typically comprise 360 UK credits (three years) and master’s degrees 180 UK credits (approximately 18 months). Concordia University Chicago (CUC) uses the US credit system. BSBI’s CUC postgraduate programmes — including the MBA and MA in Innovation and Entrepreneurship — carry 36 and 30 US credit hours, respectively, over a two-year duration. Each of these credit frameworks (ECTS, UK credits, and US credit hours) aligns with established international higher education standards, and graduates can generally use them to pursue further studies, subject to the admission criteria of their chosen university or country."

    {
        "question": "Where can I verify that BSBI degrees are approved by German authorities?",
        "answer": "The degrees delivered at the Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI) are awarded by its accredited university partners — Università Telematica Internazionale UNINETTUNO, the University for the Creative Arts (UCA), Concordia University Chicago (CUC), the University of Roehampton London, and the University of Chichester. These partner universities are officially recognised higher education institutions in their respective countries and are listed as H+ institutions in Anabin, the official database managed by the German Central Office for Foreign Education (Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen, ZAB). The H+ status confirms that the institutions are considered equivalent to recognised universities in Germany, meaning their degrees are generally accepted for academic and professional purposes within Germany. You can verify this recognition by visiting the Anabin database on the website of the Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen (ZAB) and searching for each partner university by name."

        "question": "Why can’t I find BSBI on DAAD as a listed institution?",

As the Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI) is a private higher education institution that delivers programmes in partnership with internationally accredited universities, it is not required to appear as a separate entry on the DAAD website."

    {
        "question": "Why can’t I find BSBI on the German listing, hochschulkompass.de?",

The Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BSBI) is a private higher education institution delivering programmes in partnership with internationally accredited universities, and it does not independently award German degrees.
