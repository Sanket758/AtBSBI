      "  responses: |\n",
      "   - Admission to a doctoral or PhD programme depends on the specific entry requirements of the university and country where you wish to study. While BSBI’s postgraduate programmes — such as the MA, MSc and MBA — award 90 ECTS credits, eligibility for doctoral-level study (third-cycle qualifications) is determined individually by each institution. Under the Italian higher education framework, a UNINETTUNO master’s degree (classified as a “Master’s Degree of Primo Livello”) does not automatically guarantee direct entry into a doctoral or PhD programme. Typically, applicants are expected to demonstrate a strong academic background equivalent to five years of higher education (combining first and second cycle studies), along with a solid research proposal. Admission decisions are based on merit and the specific criteria of each university. However, many BSBI graduates who have completed master’s degrees awarded by UNINETTUNO have successfully progressed to doctoral studies at recognised universities without difficulty. Additionally, UNINETTUNO now offers its own Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) programme through BSBI in Berlin, providing a clear academic progression route for students who wish to continue their studies at a doctoral level. Please also note that admission to doctoral programs requires strong GPAs, research proposals, and relevant experience. For BSBI programmes delivered in partnership with other universities: The University for the Creative Arts (UCA) uses the UK credit system, where bachelor’s degrees typically comprise 360 UK credits (three years) and master’s degrees 180 UK credits (approximately 18 months). Concordia University Chicago (CUC) uses the US credit system. BSBI’s CUC postgraduate programmes — including the MBA and MA in Innovation and Entrepreneurship — carry 36 and 30 US credit hours, respectively, over a two-year duration. Each of these credit frameworks (ECTS, UK credits, and US credit hours) aligns with established international higher education standards, and graduates can generally use them to pursue further studies, subject to the admission criteria of their chosen university or country.\n",
